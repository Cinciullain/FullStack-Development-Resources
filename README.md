- Javascript is and interpreted programming language that runs on the client side.
- All browsers have a slightly different interpreter engine

#### NodeJS is used in this project

- To install or update ReactJS, used in this project, type: ``` npm install -g create-react-app ```

- To create the project folder, select the path, and then type: ``` create-react-app <nomecartella> ```

- I use VSCode, and to do the same, open the app and add the project folder to the VSCode project. Then open terminal and write: ``` npm install ```
